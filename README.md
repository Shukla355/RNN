# RNN
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network designed for sequential data processing. They employ feedback loops, allowing information persistence over time, making them effective for tasks like natural language processing and time-series analysis. RNNs use hidden states to capture dependencies within sequential data, enabling them to learn patterns and relationships. However, they face challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients, limiting their ability to capture long-term dependencies. To address these issues, variations like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have been developed, enhancing RNNs' capacity to model and understand sequential information.
